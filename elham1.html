                <h2>King Ramses II</h2>
                <p>Ramses II, known as Ramses the Great, One of the most famous Egyptian kings who ruled Egypt in
                    its golden age, (flourished 13th century bc), King of ancient Egypt, 1279–13 bc. His family came
                    to power some decades after the reign of Akhenaton. Ramses set about restoring Egypt's power by
                    quelling rebellions in southern Syria and fighting the Hittites inconclusively at the Battle of
                    Kadesh. He led several expeditions and focused on accomplishing his goals . Perhaps the
                    best-known achievements of Ramses II are his architectural endeavors, most notable the Ramesseum
                    and the temples of Abu Simbel. Ramses II's interest in architecture resulted in the creation of
                    more monuments than any of the other ancient Egyptian pharaohs.</p>

                <h2>Eye of Ra</h2>
                <p>The Eye of Ra or Eye of Re, usually depicted as sun disk or right wedjat-eye (paired with the Eye
                    of Horus, left wedjat-eye), is an entity in ancient Egyptian mythology that functions as an
                    extension of the sun god Ra's power . The Eye of Ra represents a protective and sometimes
                    vengeful aspect of the deity.The Eye of Ra was involved in many areas of ancient Egyptian
                    religion, including in the cults of the many goddesses who are equated with it. Its life-giving
                    power was celebrated in temple rituals, and its dangerous aspect was invoked in the protection
                    of the pharaoh, of sacred places, and of ordinary people and their homes.</p>

                <h2>The Ankh</h2>
                <p>The Ankh is one of the most recognizable symbols from ancient Egypt, known as "the key of life"
                    or "cross of life" and dated to the Early Dynastic Period (c. 3150 - 2613 BCE). It is a cross
                    with a loop at the top sometimes ornamented with symbols or decorative flourishes but usually
                    just a plain gold cross.The ankh was also closely tied to the concept of the afterlife in
                    ancient Egyptian religion.It is believed to be a powerful amulet that can bring good luck and
                    protection.The “Ankh” is mainly an Ancient Egyptian Hieroglyphic letter that was commonly drawn
                    on the Ancient homes and tombs walls as a symbol of art. It symbolizes life itself, and the
                    wisdom of being alive and in power to judge with justice and fairness.</p>

                <h1>The most beautiful Egyptian queen</h1>
                <h2>Queen Nefertiti</h2>
                <p>Nefertiti was the principal wife of the pharaoh Amenhotep IV (later Akhenaten), and lived in the
                    14th century BC. Written records providing concrete historical facts about her origins, her
                    marriage, her family life, political status and death are scarce.Her reign was a time of
                    tremendous cultural upheaval, as Akhenaten reoriented Egypt's religious and political structure
                    around the worship of the sun god Aten. Nefertiti is best known for her painted sandstone bust,
                    which was rediscovered in 1913 and became a global icon of feminine beauty and power.At the
                    heart of the exhibition is Queen Nefertari, who was renowned for her beauty and prominence.
                    Called “the one for whom the sun shines,” Nefertari was the favorite wife of pharaoh Ramesses
                    II.</p>

                <h2>Hatshepsut</h2>
                <p>She was Egypt's second confirmed queen regnant, the first being Sobekneferu/Nefrusobek in the
                    Twelfth Dynasty. Hatshepsut was the daughter of Thutmose I and Great Royal Wife, Ahmose. Upon
                    the death of her husband and half-brother Thutmose II, she had initially ruled as regent to her
                    stepson, Thutmose III. she died probably in Year 22 of Thutmose III. Towards the end of the
                    reign of Thutmose III and into the reign of his son Amenhotep II, an attempt was made to remove
                    her from official accounts of Egyptian historiography. Her statues were destroyed, her monuments
                    were defaced, and many of her achievements were ascribed to other pharaohs. Many modern
                    historians attribute this to ritual and religious reasons, rather than personal hostility as
                    previously thought.</p>

                <p>Scarabs were incorporated into ancient Egyptian jewelry and were notably present in rituals
                    surrounding death. They were important symbols of rebirth and resurrection, as well as good luck
                    and fortune.Scarabs are beetle-shaped amulets and impression seals which were widely popular
                    throughout ancient Egypt. They still survive in large numbers today, and are popular among
                    collectors of ancient artifacts. Scarabs Represented Resurrection in Ancient Egypt. Because of
                    the dung beetle's significance in ancient Egypt, the scarab beetle came to represent the eternal
                    cycle of life. Like the dung beetle's revolving ball, the scarab became a symbol of birth, life,
                    death, and resurrection.</p>
