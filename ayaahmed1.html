<h3 class="para4">Writing in ancient Egypt is divided into several stages due to the different times and circumstances, which are as follows:</h3>

<div class="para">
<img src="Hieroglyphs_from_the_tomb_of_Seti_I.jpg"><h3>I.Hieroglyphs:</h3><p class="ft">4000 BCE:3500 BCE</p><p>It prevailed in the Pharaonic times from its beginning in the ancient era until the end of the Pharaonic state after the New Kingdom and then began to become extinct, it was usually written from right to left or from left to right, horizontal or vertical, which are references that include what is in nature from man, animal, plant, water, sun and other natural phenomena.«each sign was written with great attention to the details of the drawing, for example, the bird does not only show it with its side lines, but also with its various internal features, with wings, eyes and claws... etc.</p>
</div>


<div class="para">
<img src="R (2).jpeg"><h3>II.Hieratic:</h3><p class="ft">3000 BCE:Not Mentioned</p>
<p>Due to the difficulty of hieroglyphs and the difficulty of learning and using them in public affairs, hieratic writing was invented and is derived from hieroglyphs with some simplification,It was also called the priestly calligraphy, which means the line of the clergy, because the priests and clergy were the ones who used this writing a lot in all their works, and it was written on ceramics and wood, and most of the literary writings of the Egyptians were recorded in hieratic.<p>
</div>


<div class="para">
<img src="DemoticScriptsRosettaStoneReplica.jpg"><h3>III.Demoticism:</h3><p class="ft">8th century BC:5th century AD</p><p>It prevailed after the end of the modern state in the era of the last decay because of its ease on hieroglyphs and hieratics, and it was also called colloquially because of its spread among all the people and it was their vernacular language, but it was written.</p>
</div>




<div class="para last2">
<img src="127-103312-coptic-language-dictionary-history-2.jpeg"><h3>IIII.Coptic:</h3><p class="ft">Beginning of the 3rd century:The last stage in the development of writing and language
</p>
<p>It is an ancient Egyptian written in Greek letters, and the Christian clergy recorded all their writings and religious texts, and that language prevailed along with many because of the diversity of those who lived in Egypt in that period, from the pharaohs, then the Persians, the Ptolems, the Greeks, the Greeks, the Jews and even the Romans, so there were many languages and writings, so certain writing prevailed in a certain era and also for each writing field this difference and diversity was clearly shown in the Roman era, and then the Islamic conquest of Egypt took place, and thus other languages began to decline until Arabic dominated, but it is not considered one of the writings of ancient Egypt because it did not prevail until relatively advanced times, contrary to what is rumored.</p>
