    <p>
        The clothing used in the ancient world reflects the techniques that these peoples mastered,
         and antiquities play a major role in documenting this aspect of ancient life. Silk, fabrics,
          and leather are sometimes well preserved over time. The clothes worn in many cultures indicate social level. Fashion in clothing is one of human characteristics and is a feature of most human societies.
           In very ancient days, humans began to wear clothes to protect their bodies from heat, sun, rain, cold, and others. The skins of animals and plants were mainly used as clothing
            to cover their bodies.

    <h2>
        1. Royal Class
    </h2>
    <p>
        The royal costume in ancient Egypt was the most expensive and precious of costumes, and it was decorated with decorations woven with colored or embroidered threads, or by adding pieces of fabric to the ends of the garment, rimmed with gold or with single-colored or multi-colored ribbons. As for the traditional costume of kings, the painting of King Narmer is the oldest historical document of the king wearing a kilt. It was a long or short skirt with pleats, and it was called the “shandet.” Its ends intersected and folded under a belt tied in the front. The head covering was a piece of linen cloth gathered behind the head. The ancient Egyptian wore a false beard to strengthen the connection between terrorism, as they believed that gods had a straight beard, and kings wore Knitted abaya and wig for official exams.
