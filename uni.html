                <h3>Luxor temple</h3>
                <p>Luxor Temple is a large, complex ancient Egyptian temple located on the eastern bank of the Nile River in the city of Luxor today, known as (Ancient Thebes). It was founded in 1400 BC. The Luxor Temple was built for the worship of Amun Ra, his wife Mut, and their son Khonsu; They are the gods who are also called the Theban Trinity (Theban Trinity). Luxor Temple was built during the reign of the kings of the Eighteenth Dynasty and the Nineteenth Dynasty. The most important existing buildings in the temple are those built by Kings Amenhotep III (1397-1360 BC) and Ramses II (1290-1223 BC) (who added to the temple the open courtyard, the edifice, and the two obelisks). King Thutmose III (1490-1436 BC) also established shrines for visitors to the Holy Triad of Thebes, and Tutankhamun (1348-1337 BC) completed the inscriptions on its walls. The tripartite chamber, which had previously been built during the reign of Queen Hatshepsut and King Thutmose III (of the Eighteenth Dynasty), was destroyed. Then it was rebuilt during the reign of King Ramesses II. The temple was also called “Epetreset” (meaning the southern sanctuary or the private place of Amun-Ra). It is one of the best preserved and most beautiful Egyptian temples, and the layout of the Egyptian temple is clearly evident.<h3> to know more:</h3></p>
